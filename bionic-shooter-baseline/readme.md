Baseline Testing
	- Find 3 different velocities to launch the ball so they land on the field at different distances. to do this, do some ranging tests with 3 shots and put a piece of tape on the field near where they land (for a given velocity).
	- Then at a given velocity shoot 5 times with an 8-10 second delay between shots. This should give us numbers to work from when making changes.
	- After those are recorded (we can analyze later) we can start tweaking things like what happens when the balls are shot with a 2 second delay between them or put some backing material on the hood, or mess with PID values.

1000 (just outside the zone)
	- 10 count = 165052
	- Fast 3 =

1200 (middle of zone)
	- 10 count = 170147
	- Fast 3 = 171013 (did it 3x, 3rd one has video)

1600 (over the wall)
	- 10 count = 170414
	- Fast 3 =
